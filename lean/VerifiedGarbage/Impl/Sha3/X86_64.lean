# Keccak-f[1600]: x86-64 implementation

`vg_keccak_f1600(state = rdi, scratch = rsi)`.

The rounds follow Andy Polyakov's CRYPTOGAMS `keccak1600-x86_64` (the
"lane complementing" implementation of the Keccak team's implementation
overview, with the column parities and `D` in registers).

**Lane complementing.** While the rounds run, the lanes `1, 2, 8, 12, 17, 20`
(`complLanes`) of the state are kept complemented: that turns most of χ's
`¬a ∧ b` into an `∧` or an `∨` of the lanes as they are, so that χ needs one
NOT per plane instead of five. The prologue complements those lanes and the
epilogue complements them back.

`scratch` (512 bytes) is laid out as:

* `[0, 200)`: a second state, which the rounds alternate with `state`: the
  first round of each iteration reads `state` (`rdi`) and writes the second
  state (`rsi`), the second the other way round, so after the 24 rounds the
  result is back in `state`;
* `[200, 392)`: the 24 round constants, stored by the prologue;
* `[392, 440)`: the saved `rbx, rbp, r12–r15`.

A round from `s` to `d` has lanes `20–24` of its input (row 4) in
`rax, rbx, rcx, rdx, rbp` on entry, and leaves those of its output there.
It computes the column parities `C[x]` in those registers (θ), then the
`D[x]` in place, and for each plane `y` of the output the five lanes `B[x]`
of `π(ρ(θ(A)))` in `r8–r12`, from which it stores
`B[x] ⊕ (¬B[x+1] ∧ B[x+2])` (χ, with ι for lane 0), using `r13` and `r14` as
temporaries, and loading the lanes of the next plane as registers free up.
The round constant of round `2i + k` is at `[rsi + r15 + 392 + 8k]`, where
`r15 = 16i - 192` counts up to 0, which ends the loop.

Every address is a pointer plus a constant (or plus `r15`), and the only
branch is the round loop's, so only the pointers can affect timing.
