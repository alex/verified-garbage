# Structured assembly programs and their semantics

**Trusted.** Every architecture model instantiates `ISA`: a machine state, a
type of straight-line instructions with a partial semantics, and a type of
branch conditions.

Programs are `Code`: straight-line blocks of real instructions glued together
with structured control flow (`ite` and do-while `loop`), calls of other
functions (`call`) and stack frames (`frame`). The printer
(`TCB/Print.lean`) lowers the structured control flow to labels and
conditional jumps, a call to a call instruction naming the function, which
is emitted separately, and a frame to its push, its body and its pop.

## Calls

`call name body` is a call of the function `name`, whose code is `body`: its
semantics is that of the call instruction (`ISA.call`), then `body`, then the
function's return instruction (`ISA.ret`). The emitter checks that the
function it calls by that name is exactly `body` (`VG.Rust.files`).

A call instruction stores a return address (in memory or in a register),
which is where the code of the caller is loaded: the model does not know it.
On the ARM targets, a veneer that the linker may put between the call
instruction and the function (to reach it, or to switch between ARM and
Thumb code) may also change the intra-procedure-call scratch registers. So
the machine state supplies the values the model does not know, for all the
calls to come, and a contract never constrains them, so that a proof covers
every value.
The return instruction faults in the model unless it returns to that
address. The stack pointer is only changed by calls and returns and by
frames (`ISA.writesSp`, `Artifact.spSafe`), which are nested, so that the
memory a call instruction or a push stores to is below the stack pointer on
entry: never memory that the caller of the function uses.

## Stack frames

`frame push body pop` saves registers on the stack around `body`, or passes
arguments on the stack to the functions `body` calls: its semantics is that
of the push instruction (`ISA.push`), then `body`, then the pop instruction
(`ISA.pop`). The push moves the stack pointer down, stores registers there
and makes those bytes a new region at the head of the writable regions `wr`
(so that `body`, and the functions it calls, may read and write them). The
pop faults unless the stack pointer and the writable regions are those the
push left, and the frame has the size popped; it loads one register from the
frame, moves the stack pointer back up and removes the region. So frames are
nested, the stack pointer is back where it was after each one, and code may
access a frame only while it lies at or above the stack pointer (memory
below the stack pointer may be overwritten at any time, e.g. by a signal
handler). Push and pop instructions fault outside a frame (`ISA.exec`).

## Semantics, safety and leakage

`Exec M c s t s'` means: running `c` from `s` terminates in `s'` without
faulting, producing the leakage trace `t`. An instruction faults (`exec`
returns `none`) on any memory access outside the regions the state permits,
and on reading an undefined flag; so a proof of `∃ t s', Exec M c s t s' ∧ …`
establishes termination, memory safety and functional correctness at once.

The leakage trace records every memory address accessed and every branch
decision: the standard constant-time leakage model. Instructions whose timing
depends on their operand values (e.g. division) must not be part of any ISA
model.
