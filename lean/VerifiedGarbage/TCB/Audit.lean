# Environment audit

**Trusted.** Two checks the emitter runs (`Emit.driver`) on everything it
imports, besides the axiom audit (`TCB/Axioms.lean`):

* `#assert_no_compiler_overrides all run` fails if the compiler may run
  something other than what the kernel checked in the code the emitter runs.
  The emitter is compiled code: it evaluates the artifacts `all` (their code,
  signatures and documentation) and runs `run`, which prints and checks them
  (`Rust.files`), by running what the compiler made of their definitions.
  So nothing of this project they depend on, transitively, may carry
  `implemented_by`, `extern` or `export`, which substitute other code for a
  definition (or give one to a constant the kernel knows nothing of); what
  Lean and Mathlib implement so is trusted, as Lean is. And no module of this
  project (`VerifiedGarbage` or a module under it) may declare a `csimp`
  theorem (or axiom), which the compiler rewrites by in whatever it compiles
  later, or an `init`/`builtin_init` (`initialize`), which runs when the
  emitter imports its module. Any of these could make the emitter write code
  other than the code that was proven, with every proof intact. Code the
  emitter does not run may use them: e.g. a tactic's `unsafe` term, whose
  results the kernel checks.
* `#assert_spec_origin` fails unless every constant named `VG.Spec.…` that
  is not a theorem is declared in a module under `VerifiedGarbage.Spec`. A
  reviewer reads a registration file's `Spec.<Alg>.fooContract` or
  `Spec.<Alg>.fooApi` as the reviewed one in `Spec/`, but a namespace is
  not a directory: an implementation's own files could declare such a name.
  Theorems (e.g. the equation lemmas Lean generates for a `Spec/` definition
  in the module that first unfolds it) carry no data and are exempt.
