# Zeroization

**Trusted** (as every file in `Spec/`). Not a cryptographic algorithm: the
wipe of a buffer that held secrets (keys, intermediate values) before its
memory is released or reused. In Rust, stores to memory that is not read
again may be removed as dead stores; a call to a generated function, whose
code the compiler cannot see, cannot be.

This file is independent of any architecture; the contract on every target
is in `Spec/Zeroize/Contract.lean`.
