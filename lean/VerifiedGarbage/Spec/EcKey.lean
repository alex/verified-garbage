# Elliptic curve key pairs and public keys

**Trusted** (as every file in `Spec/`). For any curve of
`Spec/Weierstrass.lean`:

* the public key `Q = dG` of a private key `d` in `[1, n-1]` (FIPS 186-5
  §A.2, NIST SP 800-56A Rev. 3 §5.6.1.2);
* the uncompressed octet-string form of a point, `04 ‖ x ‖ y` (SEC 1 v2
  §2.3.3, with point compression off), and of `O`, `00`;
* the conversion of an octet string to a public key (SEC 1 §2.3.4, for the
  uncompressed form only) with public-key validation (SP 800-56A §5.6.2.3.3):
  `Q ≠ O`, both coordinates in `[0, p-1]` and `Q` on the curve. The last
  check of §5.6.2.3.3, `nQ = O`, holds for every point on the curve when
  the cofactor is 1, as it is for every curve specified here.

The compressed form (`02`/`03 ‖ x`), which needs a square root in `GF(p)`,
is not specified yet: `decodePublicKey` rejects it.
