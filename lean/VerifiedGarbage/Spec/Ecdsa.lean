# ECDSA signature generation (FIPS 186-5)

**Trusted** (as every file in `Spec/`). ECDSA over any curve of
`Spec/Weierstrass.lean`, transcribed from FIPS 186-5, *Digital Signature
Standard (DSS)* (February 2023), §6.4.1, with the private key `d` and the
per-message secret number `k` as inputs: how `k` is chosen (randomly, as in
§A.3, or deterministically, as in RFC 6979) is the caller's, and so is
hashing the message.

The hash `H` enters as the integer `e` of the leftmost `min(N, hashlen)`
bits of `H`, `N` being the bit length of `n` (`hashToInt`). The inverse
`k⁻¹ mod n` is `k^(n-2) mod n` (§B.1: `n` is prime). The signature is the
pair `(r, s)`; `encode` gives its usual fixed-length encoding, `r` then `s`,
each in `len` octets.
