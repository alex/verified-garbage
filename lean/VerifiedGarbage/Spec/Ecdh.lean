# Elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman (NIST SP 800-56A)

**Trusted** (as every file in `Spec/`). The ECC CDH primitive of NIST
SP 800-56A Rev. 3, §5.7.1.2, for any curve of `Spec/Weierstrass.lean`:
the shared secret of the private key `d` and the peer's public key `Q` is
the x-coordinate of `P = h d Q` (the cofactor `h` is 1 here), as `len`
octets (the Field-Element-to-Byte-String conversion, SEC 1 §2.3.5), and an
error if `P = O`. The peer's public key is an octet string, validated as
`EcKey.decodePublicKey` does (§5.6.2.3.3), which §5.6.2.2.2 requires
before it is used.
