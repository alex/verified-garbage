# ECDH over any curve: the contracts, on every target

**Trusted** (as every file in `Spec/`). For a curve's `EcKey.Instance`,
`vg_ecdh_<name>`, in the module `ecdh_<name>`: the ECC CDH primitive
(`Ecdh.exchange`), with the validation of the peer's public key.

The signature determines memory validity, separation and that the pointers
are public, through `Sig.contract`. The private key is secret; the peer's
public key is public, and may affect timing (`leak`): an implementation may,
for instance, reject an invalid one early. The function returns 1 and
writes the shared secret, or returns 0 and writes zeros, so the return value
depends on the private key too (whether it is in `[1, n-1]`). `scratch` is
8 KiB of working space, whose contents on return are unspecified. `stack` is
the number of bytes below the stack pointer that an implementation's calls
and frames use. The function may overwrite its arguments passed in memory,
where the calling convention allows it (`writeArgs`).
