# Elliptic curve keys over any curve: the contracts, on every target

**Trusted** (as every file in `Spec/`). An `Instance` is a curve as the Rust
interface has it: the curve, its name in the functions' names
(`vg_ec_<name>_public_key`, in the module `ec_<name>`; and the functions of
algorithms over the curve, such as `vg_ecdh_<name>`, `Spec/Ecdh/Generic.lean`),
and its name in their documentation. Each curve is an `Instance` in a file
of its own (`Spec/EcKey/P256.lean`, …).

The signature determines memory validity, separation and that the pointers
are public, through `Sig.contract`. `publicKey` keeps the private key
secret: only the pointers may affect timing. It returns 1 and writes the
public key, or returns 0 and writes zeros, so the return value depends on
the private key (whether it is in `[1, n-1]`). `scratch` is 8 KiB of
working space, whose contents on return are unspecified. `stack` is the
number of bytes below the stack pointer that an implementation's calls and
frames use. The functions may overwrite their arguments passed in memory,
where the calling convention allows it (`writeArgs`).
