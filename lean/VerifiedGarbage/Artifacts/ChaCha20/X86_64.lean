# The ChaCha20 block function (RFC 8439) on x86-64

A registration file (see `TCB/Emit.lean`): the artifacts it lists are
emitted. **Review note**: `sig` and `doc` are trusted, as they tie the Rust
caller to the contract; check them against the contract's `pre`/`post`. An
artifact made from a function's `Api` (in `Spec/`, reviewed with the
contract) takes its signature and most of its `doc` from there: what this
file adds is the `# Safety` items that depend on the target, and any notes.
