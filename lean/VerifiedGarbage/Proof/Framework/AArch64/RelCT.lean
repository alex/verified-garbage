# Constant time of calls, by relating two runs (AArch64)

As on x86-64 (`Proof/Framework/X86_64/RelCT.lean`): a call of verified code
leaks the same trace in two runs when the callee's contract holds in both
(narrowed to the regions it is given, as `WP.call` does) and its public data
agrees, since the callee's run from the narrowed state is the actual run
with fewer permissions (`Exec.widen` and determinism), and the callee is
constant time. `bl` and `ret` leak no addresses of their own.
